a folder is present in 4 area 
untracked-->unmodified-->modified-->staged

untracked --> file which is either not commited or 
                not added in staging area

tracked --> there are 3 status of tracked file
            1. unmodified 
            2. modified 
            3. commited 

suppose we have a unmodified file--> we change something 
in it --> now we have to add it to staging area first 
--> now from staging area we can commit the file to local repositery(it become latest version)
--> if we delete an unmodified file it become untracked
--> now when we add it , it goes to staging area
